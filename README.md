# Smile Detection

Smile detection is a special task in facial expression analysis with various potential applications such as photo selection, user experience analysis, smiling payment and patient monitoring. Conventional approaches often extract low-level face descriptors and detect smile based on a strong binary classifier.

Smile detection is a two-step process. First, your camera detects a face, then waits to see a smile. In more concrete terms, a motion detector divides your shot into thousands of zones, then analyzes parameters such as white balance and flash level for the face area. It is created by python language.
